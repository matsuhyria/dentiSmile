# DentiSmile+ (Group-7)

### Description

DentiSmile+ is a distributed appointment booking system designed specifically for residents of Gothenburg, Sweden, to easily find and book dentist appointments. The system provides a responsive web interface for users to view available appointment slots on a map, book or cancel appointments, and receive real-time notifications. It also includes tools for dentists to manage their schedules.

The DentiSmile+ system leverages a distributed microservices architecture combining a client-server with microservice as well as MQTT messaging to enable real-time updates.
